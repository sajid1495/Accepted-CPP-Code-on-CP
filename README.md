# Accepted C++ Code on CP

This repository contains all the C++ code that I've used to solve problems in various competitive programming contests and platforms. Each folder corresponds to a specific contest or problem set, and inside each folder, you'll find the solutions with the problem statement, where applicable.

## Structure

- `contest-name/`
  - `problem-name.cpp`: Solution code for the problem.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the solutions to understand different problem-solving techniques and approaches. You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
